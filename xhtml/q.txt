I would appreciate help writing a macro. Originally, I wrote two pairs of
similar methods. In each pair, one function XXX-as-string is implemented in
terms of XXX-to-stream. Here is one pair as an example, where XXX is "tag".

    ;; Output the tag to a stream
    (defun tag-to-stream (tag stream)
      ( ... )) ; interesting code goes here

    ;; Return the tag as a string.
    (defun tag-as-string (tag)
      (with-output-to-string (stream) (tag-to-stream tag stream)))

I started to write a macro like this

    ;; Creates a <type>-as-string method that calls <type>-to-stream.
    (defmacro as-string (type-name)
      `(with-output-to-string (stream) (,type-name

and I got stuck. How do I concatenate the macro argument with "-to-stream"
to form the function name that I am trying to generate? In other words, I
want the macro call

    (as-string tag)

to generate

    (with-output-to-string (stream) (tag-to-stream tag stream))

Thank you for any pointers and help.
